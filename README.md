# Kubernetes in Codespaces

> Setup a Kubernetes cluster using `k3d` running in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Overview

This is a template that will setup a Kubernetes developer cluster using `k3d` in a `GitHub Codespace`

We use this for `inner-loop` Kubernetes development. Note that it is not appropriate for production use but is a great `Developer Experience`. Feedback calls the approach `game-changing` - we hope you agree!

For ideas, feature requests, and discussions, please use GitHub discussions so we can collaborate and follow up.

This Codespace is tested with `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`.

You can connect to the Codespace with a local version of VS Code.

Please experiment and add any issues to the GitHub Discussion.

The motivation for creating and using Codespaces is highlighted by this [GitHub Blog Post](https://github.blog/2021-08-11-githubs-engineering-team-moved-codespaces/). "It eliminated the fragility and single-track model of local development environments, but it also gave us a powerful new point of leverage for improving GitHubâ€™s developer experience."

Cory Wilkerson, Senior Director of Engineering at GitHub, recorded a podcast where he shared the GitHub journey to [Codespaces](https://changelog.com/podcast/459)

- To shutdown a codespace immediately
  - Click `Codespaces` in the lower left of the browser window
  - Choose `Stop Current Codespace` from the context menu

- You can also rebuild the container that is running your Codespace
  - Any changes in `/workspaces` will be retained
  - Other directories will be reset
  - Click `Codespaces` in the lower left of the browser window
  - Choose `Rebuild Container` from the context menu
  - Confirm your choice

- To delete a Codespace
  - <https://github.com/codespaces>
  - Use the context menu to delete the Codespace
  - Please delete your Codespace once you complete the lab
    - Creating a new Codespace only takes about 45 seconds!

## Checking the k3d Cluster

- A k3d cluster is created as part of the Codespace setup
  - `kic` is a small CLI that we use to simplify Kubernetes development

  ```bash

  # check the pods
  kic pods

  ```

- Output from `kic pods` should resemble this

  ```text

## Validate Deployment

- If you get an error, just run the command again - it will clear once the services are ready

```bash

# check endpoints
kic check all

```

### Validating endpoints

Open [curl.http](./curl.http)

> [curl.http](./curl.http) is used in conjuction with the Visual Studio Code [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension.
>
> When you open [curl.http](./curl.http), you should see a clickable `Send Request` text above each of the URLs

![REST Client example](./images/RESTClient.png)

Clicking on `Send Request` should open a new panel in Visual Studio Code with the response from that request like so:

![REST Client example response](./images/RESTClientResponse.png)

## Jump Box

A `jump box` pod is created so that you can execute commands `in the cluster`

- use the `kj` alias
  - example
    - run `kj`
      - Your terminal prompt will change
      - From the `jumpbox` terminal
      - Run `http imdb.imdb.svc.cluster.local:8080/version`
      - `exit` back to the Codespaces terminal

- use the `kje` alias
  - example
    - run http against the ClusterIP
      - `kje http imdb.imdb.svc.cluster.local:8080/version`

- Since the jumpbox is running `in` the cluster, we use the service name and port, not the NodePort
  - A jumpbox is great for debugging network issues

## NodePorts

- Codespaces exposes `ports` to the local browser
- We take advantage of this by exposing `NodePort` on most of our K8s services
- Codespaces ports are setup in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file

- Exposing the ports

  ```json

  // forward ports for the app
  "forwardPorts": [
    30000,
    30080,
    31080,
    32000
  ],

  ```

- Adding labels to the ports

  ```json

  // add labels
  "portsAttributes": {
    "30000": { "label": "Prometheus" },
    "30080": { "label": "IMDb-app" },
    "31080": { "label": "Heartbeat" },
    "32000": { "label": "Grafana" },
  },

  ```

## View IMDB App

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the IMDb-App port (30080)
- This will open the imdb-app home page (Swagger) in a new browser tab

## View Heartbeat

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Heartbeat port (31080)
- This will open the heartbeat home page (Swagger) in a new browser tab
  - Note that you will see page `Under construction ...` as heartbeat does not have a UI
  - Add `version` or `/heartbeat/17` to the end of the URL in the browser tab

## Build and deploy a local version of imdb-app

- We have a local Docker container registry running in the Codespace
  - Run `docker ps` to see the running images
- Build the WebAPI app from the local source code
- Push to the local Docker registry
- Deploy to local k3d cluster

- Switch back to your Codespaces tab

  ```bash

  # from Codespaces terminal

  # make and deploy a local version of imdb-app to k8s
  kic build imdb

  # check the app version
  # the semver will have the current date and time
  http localhost:30080/version

  ```

## Validate deployment with k9s

> To exit K9s - `:q <enter>`

- From the Codespace terminal window, start `k9s`
  - Type `k9s` and press enter
  - Press `0` to select all namespaces

  - Use the arrow key to select `webv` pod for `heartbeat` then press the `l` key to view logs from the pod
    - Notice that WebV is making a heartbeat request every 5 seconds
    - To go back, press the `esc` key

  - Use the arrow key to select `webv` pod for `imdb` then press the `l` key to view logs from the pod
    - Notice that WebV is making 10 IMDb requests per second
    - To go back, press the `esc` key

  - Use the arrow key to select `jumpbox` then press `s` key to open a shell in the container
    - Test the `IMDb-App` service from within the cluster by executing

      ```bash

      # httpie is a "pretty" version of curl
      # test the webv-imdb service endpoint using local DNS
      http webv.imdb.svc.cluster.local:8080/metrics

      ```

      - `exit <enter>`
  - To view other resources - press `shift + :` followed by the deployment type (e.g. `secret`, `services`, `deployment`, etc).

![k9s](./images/k9s.png)

## View Fluent Bit Logs

> Fluent Bit is set to forward logs to stdout for debugging
>
> Fluent Bit can be configured to forward to different services including Grafana Cloud or Azure Log Analytics
>
> Fluent Bit is also installed in the Codespace to simplify debugging new configurations. Run `fluent-bit --help` for more details.

- Start `k9s` from the Codespace terminal (if it's not running from previous step)
- Press `0` to show all `namespaces`
- Select `fluentbit` pod and press `enter`
- Press `enter` again to see the logs
- Press `s` to Toggle AutoScroll
- Press `w` to Toggle Wrap
- Review logs that will be sent to Grafana when configured

> To exit K9s - `:q <enter>`

## View Prometheus Dashboard

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
- Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Prometheus port (30000)
- This will open Prometheus in a new browser tab

- From the Prometheus tab
  - Begin typing `ImdbAppDuration_bucket` in the `Expression` search
  - Click `Execute`
  - This will display the log table that Grafana uses for the charts

## View Grafana Dashboard

- Grafana login info
  - admin
  - cse-labs

- Click on the `ports` tab of the terminal window
  - Click on the `open in browser icon` on the Grafana port (32000)
  - This will open Grafana in a new browser tab

![Codespace Ports](./images/CodespacePorts.jpg)

> `IMDb-App` dashboard is set as the default home dashboard to visualize constant load generated to the IMDB application.

![Grafana](./images/imdb-requests-by-mode.png)

### Explore Grafana Dashboards

- Click on the dashboard folder `General` at the top (with four squares) to access the dashboard search. The dashboard search can also be opened by using the shortcut `F`.
- The list will show all the dashboards configured in Grafana.
- We configure two dashboards as part of the initial deployment:
  - IMDb App
  - Dotnet

## Run integration and load tests

```bash

# from Codespaces terminal

# run an integration test (will generate warnings in Grafana)
kic test integration

# run a 30 second load test
kic test load

```

- Switch to the Grafana browser tab
- The integration test generates 400 and 404 results by design
- The requests metric will go from green to yellow to red as load increases
  - It may skip yellow
- As the test completes
  - The metric will go back to green (10 req/sec)
  - The request graph will return to normal

## How Codespaces is built

Codespaces extends the use of development containers by providing a remote hosting environment. A development container is a fully-featured development environment running in a Docker container.

Developers can simply click on a button in GitHub to open a Codespace for the repo. Behind the scenes, GitHub Codespaces is:

- Starting a VM
- Shallow clone the repo in that VM. The shallow clone pulls the `devcontainer.json` onto the VM
- Start the development container on the VM
- Clone the repository in the development container
- Connect to the remotely hosted development container via the browser or Visual Studio Code

`.devcontainer` folder contains the following:

- `devcontainer.json`: This configuration file determines the environment for new Codespaces created for the repository by defining a development container that can include frameworks, tools, extensions, and port forwarding. For more information about the settings and properties that you can set in a devcontainer.json, see [devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile in `.devcontainer` defines a container image and installs software. You can use an existing base image by using the `FROM` instruction. For more information on using a Dockerfile in a dev container, see [Create a development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container#_dockerfile) in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

- `Bash scripts`: We store lifecycle scripts under the `.devcontainer` folder. They are the hooks that allow you to run commands at different points in the development container lifecycle which include:
  - onCreateCommand - Run when creating the container
  - postCreateCommand - Run after the container is created
  - postStartCommand - Run every time the container starts

  For more information on using Lifecycle scripts, see [Codespaces lifecycle scripts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference#_lifecycle-scripts).

  > Note: Provide executable permissions to scripts using: `chmod+ x`.

```

## FAQ

- Why don't we use helm to deploy Kubernetes manifests?
  - The target audience for this repository is app developers so we chose simplicity for the Developer Experience.
  - In our daily work, we use Helm for deployments and it is installed in the `Codespace` should you want to use it.
- Why `k3d` instead of `Kind`?
  - We love kind! Most of our code will run unchanged in kind (except the cluster commands)
  - We had to choose one or the other as we don't have the resources to validate both
  - We chose k3d for these main reasons
    - Smaller memory footprint
    - Faster startup time
    - Secure by default
      - K3s supports the [CIS Kubernetes Benchmark](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/security/hardening_guide/)
    - Based on [K3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) which is a certified Kubernetes distro
      - Many customers run K3s on the edge as well as in CI-CD pipelines
    - Rancher provides support - including 24x7 (for a fee)
    - K3s has a vibrant community
    - K3s is a CNCF sandbox project
